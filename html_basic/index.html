  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page created as part of my ALX Front-End Web Development journey. It contains headings, paragraphs, and an image.</p>

  <h3>Why HTML Matters</h3>
  <p>HTML forms the basic structure of web pages. It allows developers to define content, organize layout, and link to other resources.</p>

  <p>I am learning how to use semantic tags like headings and paragraphs to structure content effectively.</p>

  <p>This is one of my very first webpages, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building more!</p>
