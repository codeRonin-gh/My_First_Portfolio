  <h1>My Journey into Web Development</h1>
  <p>I have recently started learning HTML as part of the ALX Front-End Web Development program. It's exciting to finally bring my ideas to life through code.</p>

  <h2>Why I Chose Web Development</h2>
  <p>The web is everywhere, and understanding how it works opens so many doors. I want to create websites that are beautiful, functional, and impactful.</p>

  <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
  <p>My short-term goal is to build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. Eventually, I want to explore JavaScript and build interactive web applications.</p>

  <p>This is just the beginning of a lifelong journey in tech. Every line of code is a step toward becoming a world-class developer.</p>
